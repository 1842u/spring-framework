/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in the
 * bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access to
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * <p><b>The container is only responsible for managing the lifecycle of the FactoryBean
 * instance, not the lifecycle of the objects created by the FactoryBean.</b> Therefore,
 * a destroy method on an exposed bean object (such as {@link java.io.Closeable#close()})
 * will <i>not</i> be called automatically. Instead, a FactoryBean should implement
 * {@link DisposableBean} and delegate any such close call to the underlying object.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
 * <p>接口：由在 {@link BeanFactory} 中使用的对象实现，这些对象本身是单个对象的工厂。如果一个 bean 实现了这个接口，它将作为一个工厂用于暴露对象，而不是直接作为将要暴露的 bean 实例。
 *
 * <p><b>注意：实现这个接口的 bean 不能用作普通 bean。</b>
 * 一个 FactoryBean 是以 bean 样式定义的，但通过 bean 引用 ({@link #getObject()}) 暴露的对象总是它创建的对象。
 *
 * <p>FactoryBean 可以支持单例和原型，并且可以在需求时延迟创建对象或在启动时立即创建对象。{@link SmartFactoryBean} 接口允许暴露更细粒度的行为元数据。
 *
 * <p>这个接口在框架内部被大量使用，例如用于 AOP 的 {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} 或 {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}。它也可以用于自定义组件；然而，这通常仅适用于基础设施代码。
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} 是一个编程契约。实现不应该依赖于注解驱动的注入或其他反射机制。</b> {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} 调用可能在启动过程中较早到达，甚至在任何后处理器设置之前。如果需要访问其他 bean，请实现 {@link BeanFactoryAware} 并以编程方式获取它们。
 *
 * <p><b>容器只负责管理 FactoryBean 实例的生命周期，而不负责 FactoryBean 创建的对象的生命周期。</b> 因此，暴露的 bean 对象上的销毁方法（例如 {@link java.io.Closeable#close()}）不会自动调用。相反，FactoryBean 应该实现 {@link DisposableBean} 并将任何此类关闭调用委托给底层对象。
 *
 * <p>最后，FactoryBean 对象参与包含它的 BeanFactory 的 bean 创建同步。通常不需要内部同步，除了在 FactoryBean 本身内部的延迟初始化（或类似情况）之外。
 * <p>
 * <p>当配置某个bean实现了FactoryBean接口时，该bean返回的对象不是FactoryBean本身，而是FactoryBean#getObject()方法返回的对象
 * <p>当你遇到需求类似"我需在Runtime时动态地配置我的bean" 或者 "我需要确保我的bean是复杂生产步骤下的产物"时，那么FactoryBean就是你的不二之选。
